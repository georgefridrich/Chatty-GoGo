# Chatty-GoGo
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Chatty-GoGo exists as a fun project for my team to learn the process of creating a classic three tier web application and deploy it in a managed and scalable environment.  Chatty-GoGo is a GO based application using the Gin-Gonic http framework.  We will persist user messages using MySQL.  The presentation layer will be written in React.  Once we have a working beta we'll likely use AWS Lightsail to host our application.</p>
<p>REST API message service written in GO using GIN</p>
